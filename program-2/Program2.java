/*

main function:
--------------

input file:
    - contains integers (r"(-?\d+)") and words (strings; r"([A-Za-z]+['\-\d]*)")
output file:
    - contains each unique word and number of occurrences
    - ordered by first encountered
    - end of list: total number of unique words, sum of integers


notes:
    - can enter input or input and output files in command line
    - validate files; reprompt until valid or until nothing (quit)
    - use StringTokenizer to parse input file
    - for each word, either add to count (if exists) or create new Word, add to list


more detailed steps:
    - check inputs from command line
    - validate files
        - if any invalid, reprompt
        - if any empty prompts, quit program
    - open PrintWriter and FileReader
    - create StringTokenizer
    - while a line exists:
        - while tokens in line:
            - determine if token is word or int
                - word: check word list, create word/add occurrence
                - int: add to sum
    - print each unique word to output, include number of occurrences
    - print total number of unique words, sum of integers
